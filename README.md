# lua_spell_overlay

lua_spell_overlay is an Eluna module designed for efficient management of spell overlays.



#### Project Overview

lua_spell_overlay is a system that works by interacting with a database to manage spell overlays. Equipped with advanced features, it provides developers with a straightforward and efficient approach to handle various spell overlay-related tasks.



#### Key Features

lua_spell_overlay includes several significant features:

- **Database-driven Management:** The module includes condition rules and relations that control the spell overlays, and these rules are directly stored in a database. This design allows for flexible and dynamic control over every spell overlay.

- **Automatic Spell Overlay Application:** Based on the defined conditions in the database, the system implicitly controls the presence of the spell overlays.

- **Customizable Overlays:** With lua_spell_overlay, developers can easily modify overlay textures according to their requirements, giving each overlay a unique look.

- **Minimal Coding Required:** The system is designed to minimize the need for additional programming, making lua_spell_overlay user-friendly even for those with a non-technical background.



### How to use lua_spell_overlay

lua_spell_overlay requires a database to function, this database should contain the conditions and relationships for the spell overlays. Once set up, the system can be controlled and manipulated directly from the database, allowing modification of the spell overlays without the need for coding.
